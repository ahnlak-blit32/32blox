# 32Blox

This is a breakout-style game for the 32Blit console.

![Build](https://github.com/ahnlak-blit32/32blox/workflows/Build/badge.svg)

It's been rebuilt from the ground up to reflect the current state of the
32Blit API, as we approach release.

As before, this is more of a technical demonstration than a formal tutorial.
I am probably not doing everything "the right way" (see also, the rambling
debates I'm having with DaftFreak about CMake files!), but with any luck it
will at least give you a starting point for your own projects.

Share, and Enjoy!
